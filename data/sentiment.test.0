i complained and received a complimentary room for one night .
prices are sometimes good and bad .
the lady behind the register was straight up ignorant and rude !
wrong !
noticed _num_ employees eating lunch and they had pizza from another restaurant ?
i was there for _num_ hours .
honestly they were down right rude .
well , _num_ rolls around and nobody is here .
the bathroom floor was broken and dirt was left behind .
it does not even deserve the one star .
for _num_ minutes ... with nobody to help me .
and finally , the sunday champagne buffet brunch was terrible .
this was a huge disappointment .
i wo n't be staying at this property again .
this airport sucks .
however , if you are vegetarian , skip it .
i came here on a monday night around 9pm .
since the mgr changed this place has gone down hill .
if they care , they should be doing something about all these negative reviews .
the rest of the visit was a sad experience .
no one asked if i needed help or anything .
but i ate it .
i had to go look for someone to ask them for a box .
it was smashed , poorly put together , veggies everywhere , soggy .
they do have a cheap gift shop when you walk in but its small .
while the ac worked well , it was extremely loud and noisy .
our waitress was very slow .
not really that impressed with this place at all ... .
there were even more mistakes to sizes and proportions .
after about _num_ minutes a hispanic family was seated behind us .
i tried hitting `` return '' to return my money , and guess what ?
horrible horrible customer service .
hallways dirty , food outside rooms kept there for days .
i do n't see how it 's still going .
we are all lucky that nothing worse happened to us during our stay .
that pretty much ruined my experience .
it 's not surprising , since it 's vegas .
just thinking about flying into this airport makes my skin crawl .
they charged me taxes twice and they could n't even explain why .
granted it 's only a $ _num_ , but really ?
and wireless does n't work .
_num_ bartenders , and _num_ servers .
the bar was pretty lame .
_num_ tacos for $ _num_ - tasted like it was from taco bell .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
do n't trust this place .
showed up , they looked closed .
spend a little extra money and go stay somewhere better .
i walked in and out in about _num_ minutes .
i 'm just so glad website like yelp exist .
is my money and broken window not good enough ?
overall , it was horrible .
as a banquet venue , they were below expectations .
again , tasteless .
that i did n't want to go inside and make a deal .
she does not smile or give you a `` thank you ! ''
higher tier rooms are of better quality .
are you freaking kidding me ?
the girls up front incompetent .
if i show up when they are there , my beer is free .
staff was rude .
attempted to get an appointment .
would n't recommend until management works on friendliness and communication with residents .
they must not treat their employees well is all i can say .
worst pawn shop ever !
the steak place across from the buffet is delicious .
$ _num_ tab for _num_ adult and _num_ kids wtf ?
i had stuffed shells and grandma had manicotti .
i could n't stand it .
the better dishes are $ _num_ and up .
hell yes .
the old dirty green carpet and old curtains and lamps were horrible .
they reset my key , not theirs .
not so friendly waitress ( sushi chef was nice ) .
worst customer service ever .
refund my money .
will not be back .
this seems like it would be a fire hazard .
i just think i will stay away from this place .
drove all the way from la for a convention show .
it did n't do much for me at all .
full disclosure : i cancelled my appointment before even receiving any services here .
my husband had never even heard of them , let alone dined there .
not a fan .
this place sucks .
but nobody else was in the store .
we immediately went to the concierge to complain .
it is obvious that there are issues here .
las vegas needs to get it together .
the child had to eat crackers .
i also ordered tacos and they were n't very good either .
even though i 'm totally unable to do a weekday .
las vegas has a long history of money , music , and entertainment .
we decided to grab a fast bite at the food court .
i never in my life had a horrible experience like yesterday on easter .
maybe small jobs are not worth their time ?
so i ordered , and low and behold .
... ok ... but your window says same day .
the door handle to get out had some dripping white stuff dried all over .
anyhow i just wanted to express my extreme disappointment in this particular location .
the meat was seriously over cooked , and the beans and rice were bland .
no one ever had the carpets replaced , or even cleaned .
it needs renovations and a better cleaning crew .
the absolute worst `` fish '' and chips i have ever experienced .
there were only five tables occupied .
this was the worst meal we had .
it was n't worth standing there , we left the drinks and walked out .
she continued to ignore him and refused to turn around .
should have taken it as a sign .
could be so much better !
overall , glad i did n't pay full price for dinner .
their voice mail and website say they will contact you within _num_ hours .
soggy salad ?
seven tables inside the dining area needed attention and there was no temperature control .
that 's probably why i have n't came in a long time .
this is totally false !
i 'm not paying $ _num_ for chinese crap .
do not eat here if you are looking for gluten free .
now i 'm at home , in pain with no meds .
pathetic .
we were utterly disappointed .
they are fast like many have said , but you feel really rushed .
