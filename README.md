# style-transfer-model-evaluation

This is the Python 3 companion codebase for the NAACL-HLT 2019 paper *Evaluating Style Transfer for Text*.

📁 **code** - metrics to evaluate outputs of examined style transfer models

📁 **data** - training and test datasets used in experiments

📁 **evaluations** - human and automated evaluations of style transfer model outputs

📁 **models** - miscellaneous models used for running experiments (not the style transfer models themselves)

📁 **style_lexicon** - words used to compile style lexicon used in evaluation of content preservation

📁 **transfer_model_outputs** - outputs of examined style transfer models

Dependencies: gensim, keras, matplotlib, pyemd, scipy, sklearn
