we did n't feel rushed and took a couple of hours .
this place is a complete disappointment and utter disappointment .
was it good ?
thanks for the disappointment itself .
the ingredients are fresh and the food is mediocre .
simply not .
bad luck .
the food was always tasteless and i always will never come back again .
surprisingly , this place was very very bad .
shrimp was burnt in the grease with no flavor .

this place is worth the wait !
the food was good and nothing special .
the food was incredible but the service was terrible .
there is no parking on the floor who use the car that works there .
she is that bad !
they are terrific .
i have been here _num_ times and the food was cold and not good .
everyone at least _num_ minutes .
it 's a motel _num_ , with tons of limited items and msg .
do not shop , you 'd like to lose your business .
she said she was `` _num_ cents '' .
the hotel was nice , the room was not clean .
avoid in the future if you have any options .
she offered a meal with a terrible meal .
oh and , is n't everything to work with ?
embarrassed down to go out of a business resort .
nor my husband is fast and i will not return to my house .
met us at the front desk and did nothing .
overall just a _num_ star rating ... .
easy to sleep with .
the view , the food , the staff , was terrible .
there was absolutely nothing wrong with my daughter .
it 's not .
the pool area is clean but not clean .
and room is very dirty .
no thanks for the sushi on a friday .
our carne asada tacos tasted stale and old .
then someone threw my nails .
it was a no exaggeration .
the staff was so rude and helpful .
-the is a rip-off !
sink was pretty good to say that 's not even a busy night .
_num_ dollars something not .
what a terrible experience for this restaurant .
wow .
neither who knows good food .
not her .
overall the food was very bad .
bad and bad !
avoid this airport if you 're looking .
the food is nothing but the food that was n't very good .
_num_ star !
and - there is no way the staff .
one of the worst restaurants in vegas !
the beer is so damn bad .
fast , efficient and attentive .
it was about $ _num_ for the full price but not worth it .
the men 's restroom are disgusting .
really busy , the atmosphere was a huge problem .
i will not be back for more than _num_ mins .
not even close to the worst vegas location every day .
i called and ordered the beds instead .
the cons : the service was lacking and the food was below average .
smh ... and not quality .
anyhow , i asked to make a reservation like that she had no idea .
i love the decor and the decor is outdated .
this time for a quick bite on a thursday .
not relaxing this morning .
the owner or manager is rude and very unprofessional .
the owner and staff are just rude .
no meat and no sides .
_num_ strikes with out of _num_ options .
horrible service !
the ambiance here is amazing .
i always feel better after leaving him .
horrible lunch specials and gluten free menu .
thank you for everything .
service is adequate , but a joke .
not this place .
i was disappointed and will never purchase here again .
i would n't recommend going somewhere else where they 're going .
everyone that works there is better than this is a joke .
it 's just nasty food and service was ok .
see you soon !
pedicure was broken in a burnt oil cut .
we are _num_ to go .
so the good thing i go !
it is slow and never clean .
really bad asian food .
the parking sucks but that 's about $ _num_ is ridiculous !
wow .
plus the restaurant is not clean in the wall .
all for $ _num_ .
staff was friendly but the food was just awful .
i dunno really bad .
this place gets crazy busy but the wait time is crazy and slow .
i would definitely give you a _num_ star review .
please please go somewhere else and your own dogs .
you will just not be disappointed .
this place is a rip off .
it felt like we did n't get the money .
worst wax i 've ever had .
also , their employees are not friendly or helpful at all .
other than that , the place was ok .
the owners know you are out and you .
pretty much better than the rest .
the restaurant was n't very clean and the waitress was nice and attentive .
and then i did n't have one .
wow , it 's not the same thing you ca n't imagine saying .
this was a poorly ran dining experience .
everyone is always so rude .
the jewelry and internet is worthless .
bill tech was never refilled .
even the lettuce was mostly old and dry .
lots of things but not to look at .
he is the worst .
it was delicious .
by far the worst `` dinner '' food ever !
thank you for coming to bmw of how long their hair sucked .
