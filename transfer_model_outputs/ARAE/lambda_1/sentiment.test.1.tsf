we did n't sit back and they took us in until _num_ minutes .
this place is a vegas dump and use .
was it good !
thanks for the entire process .
the ingredients are fresh and the food is bad .
simply not .
good luck .
the food was always awesome and i always do n't write home about .
surprisingly , this place was very very good .
oysters are excellent so i did n't give them the same .
worst tasting food !
he will get away from customers and wear gloves and are ignored .
wow ... .
this place is worth the wait !
the food was good and had taste .
the food was incredible but the service was terrible .
do n't think there is nothing to see about this place .
she is that bad !
they are terrific .
i have been here _num_ times and the pizza was ok .
everyone at ashley is horrible .
it 's a lot of potential , and with its standards .
needless to say , we found the same manager named joey .
she said she would not be a patient .
the hotel was nice , the room was empty .
highly recommend stopping by if you 're in the area .
she started with a terrible start by that time .
oh and have to say that is how bad it was .
south strip makes it so difficult and easy .
unless i was told my waitress is extremely rude and condescending .
met us at the house and did n't make an appointment .
overall just not worth their patients anymore .
easy to begin with .
the view , the food , the staff was all wrong .
do n't think i was expecting more and helpful .
it 's not the greatest at all , it was bland .
the pool area is clean and floors are filthy .
and room is very dated .
no one ever given a zero star rating .
our waiter never refilled our waters and brought us back to their table .
everyone always missed my nails .
it was a horrible decision .
do n't waste your time or money here .
granted is a lie !
meanwhile salad was pretty cool to try and not worth the wait .
not chicago style pizza .
what happened for me was a great value .
wow .
buying tickets was good .
not her .
overall the food was very bad .
bad and fast !
highly recommend taking any pet here .
the food is n't bad and the music was a typical long nightmare .
not food .
and - there is no lunch there .
one of the worst deals in vegas !
do n't get that damn chances .
fast , efficient and attentive .
it 's about $ _num_ for the full price of $ _num_ .
the name department and switch are unprofessional .
really enjoyed the food , atmosphere , and prices are outrageous .
i will not be back for more soon .
not even close to the vegas option for anyone else .
nice rooms and comfortable beds .
the sheets are sticky and the service was mediocre .
sigh ... and no quality !
nope , i wanted to leave something out of the story .
i did n't even know what the entire situation was .
perfect for a large night on a tuesday night for _num_ minutes .
cold rib eye .
the owner or server was very friendly and accommodating .
the owner and staff are absolutely rude .
no meat and no sides .
not worth it to hang out with .
horrible service !
the ambiance here is amazing .
i always feel better after seeing him .
no lunch specials and daily items are not worth the money .
thank you for everything !
service is stellar , and nothing fun .
not this place !
i was disappointed and will never shop here again .
i would not recommend these folks before going here .
everyone that works there is awesome , but do n't mind me .
it 's just the worst car 's open late !
see you soon !
pedicure is burnt water temp , and she never returned a refill .
we are bad to go .
so you must go wrong !
it is dirty and well stocked .
really good fresh food .
the parking sucks and this place is super outdated !
wow .
plus the restaurant in itself is not good .
all for me .
staff was terrible but the food was even worse .
i dunno really bad .
this place gets busy on the weekends but the wait staff was slow .
i would definitely give you a try to give you a chance .
please please please avoid this place at all costs .
you will just be disappointed .
this place is a complete rip off .
it felt like we did n't get it .
worst manicure i 've ever had .
also , their employees are extremely rude and there are only _num_ patients .
other than that , the place was terrible and will never return .
the owners know you do n't get me with you .
pretty much the past sunday was coming here .
the restaurant was n't very nice and the waitress was n't friendly .
and one of the worst chinese food i have ever eaten .
wow , it certainly took _num_ minutes to get the bill .
this was a nice dining dining experience .
everyone is always so rude .
the jewelry and billing is worthless .
next time renting for them .
even their take home depot fell apart .
lots of things are safe and not at all .
he is the worst .
it was gross .
by far the worst `` prime rib dinner '' !
thank you for old man , how does a mess !
