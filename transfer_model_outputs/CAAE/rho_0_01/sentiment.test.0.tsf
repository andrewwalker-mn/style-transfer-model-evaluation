i complained and received a complimentary room for one night .
prices are good but bad .
the lady behind the register was straight up and friendly !
wrong !
noticed _num_ employees eating lunch and they had an pizza restaurant ?
i was there for hours .
honestly they were right down .
well , _num_ rolls around and is nobody here .
the bathroom floor was broken and said was left .
it does not even deserve the one star .
for _num_ minutes at nobody to help me .
finally , and the sunday brunch buffet was great .
this was a huge disappointment .
i wo n't be staying at this property .
this airport sucks .
however , if you are vegetarian , skip .
i came here on a monday night around .
since the gm this place has gone down hill .
if they care , they should be doing all about these negative reviews .
the rest of the experience was a sad .
no one asked if i needed help or anything .
but i ate it .
i had to go there for them to ask for a box .
it was beautifully prepared , together , veggies , soggy everywhere .
they do have a great gift shop when you walk in but its small .
while the ac worked well , it was extremely loud and noisy .
our waitress was very slow .
really impressed that with this place at all ... .
there were even more servers to dates and .
after about _num_ minutes a family persons was seated us .
i tried `` new trip '' to return , and what i guess !
awesome customer great service .
beautiful square bar , waitress kept there for days .
i do n't see how it 's still going .
we are all lucky that nothing happened to us during our stay .
pretty much that my experience .
it 's surprising , since it 's vegas .
just thinking about making this airport makes my skin light .
they charged me twice and they could n't even explain why .
granted it 's only a $ _num_ , but really ?
and does n't work anymore .
_num_ bartenders , and _num_ servers .
the bar was pretty lame .
_num_ tacos for $ _num_ - it was like taco from taco .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
do n't trust this .
showed up , they worked .
spend a little extra money and go somewhere elsewhere .
i walked in and out in about _num_ .
i 'm just so glad like yelp exist .
is my money window and not good enough ?
overall , it was great .
as a concert venue , they were below expectations .
again , delicious .
that i did n't want to go inside and make a deal .
she does not smile or give you a `` thank you ! ''
higher sodas are better of quality .
are you freaking kidding me ?
the girls up dental dental .
if i show up when there are , my beer is free .
staff was friendly .
attempted to get an appointment .
would n't recommend management where on friendliness and communication with residents .
they will not treat their employees all well i can say .
best pawn shop ever !
the steak place from the buffet is delicious .
$ _num_ tab for _num_ adult kids and wtf !
i had stuffed shells and had heard .
i could n't stand .
the better dishes are $ _num_ and up .
wow yes .
the old old clean and beautiful trees and jacuzzi were fantastic .
they marked my key , not theirs .
not so friendly waitress ( chef ) was nice .
best customer service ever .
refund my money .
will be back .
this seems like it would be a fire hazard .
i just think i will stay away from this place .
drove all way from the la for a vehicle .
it did n't do much for me at .
full disclosure : i cancelled my appointment before even any services here .
my husband never had all of them , let alone dined there .
not a fan .
this place sucks .
but nobody else was in the store .
we immediately went to the concierge to .
it is obvious that there are issues .
las vegas needs to get it together .
the child had to eat .
i also ordered tacos and they were n't very good .
even though i 'm unable to do a weekday .
las vegas has a long spot of music , entertainment , and .
we decided to grab a fast meal at the food court .
i never had my life in a horrible experience on easter yesterday .
maybe small jobs are worth their time ?
so , i ordered and low and .
ok ... ... but your window says same day .
the door door had to get out some sort light stuff over all .
anyhow i just wanted to express my extreme purchase in this location .
the meat was seriously cooked , and the beans and rice were delicious .
no one ever had the carpets , replaced or even cleaned .
it needs a better work and crew .
the absolute best `` fish '' chips and i have ever experienced .
there were only two tables occupied .
this was the best meal we had .
it was n't worth standing there , we left the drinks and walked out .
she continued to ignore him and made to turn .
should have taken it as a sign .
could be so much !
overall , i did n't mind full price for dinner .
their voice mail website and they will give you within _num_ hours .
delicious salad ?
seven tables inside the dining area needed there and was no heat control .
that 's why i have n't had done in a long time .
this is totally homemade !
i 'm not paying $ _num_ for crap .
do not eat here if you are looking for gluten .
now i 'm in home at pain , with no meds .
pathetic .
we were utterly disappointed .
they are incredibly high , but have said you feel really rushed .
